# Mobile Computing Assignment 2
The Android Application asks the user if a number is prime or not. The user is required to answer with a "True" or a "False". The 
numbers are generated randomly between 1-1000 using the `Random()` function. Clicking the "Next" button would generate a different random
number.
Two new buttons: `Cheat` and `Hint` have been added to the code as two separate activities. These buttons provide answers and hints to the user, respectively. Some design changes have also been made.
The UI of the app has been designed using `flat` design buttons, and other `drawable` elements.
The App uses `API 24`, and `Java-1.8 SDK`.
